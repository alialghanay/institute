This README provides an overview of the "Study and Examinations System for Higher and Intermediate Institutes" project, a comprehensive solution aimed at modernizing academic and administrative operations. This project was developed as part of my journey with IZAR Tech, highlighting our commitment to robust software engineering principles even through challenging transitions.

### Project Overview

The "Study and Examinations System for Higher and Intermediate Institutes" is designed to manage the educational and administrative aspects of higher and intermediate institutes[cite: 20]. Its primary goal is to organize academic studies and examinations, improve administrative efficiency, and ensure transparency in academic operations[cite: 21]. The system seeks to streamline daily processes, enhancing overall performance and minimizing manual errors[cite: 22].

The current system in such institutes often relies on manual and traditional procedures, leading to potential human errors, delays, and a lack of real-time information[cite: 151]. This project addresses these challenges by offering a unified platform for efficient management of various functions, accessible via web and mobile applications[cite: 146, 165].

### Project Structure (Conceptual)

This repository serves as the main hub for the project. The codebase is logically divided into client (web and mobile) and server components.

```
institute-management-system/
├── client/         # Next.js / React.js web application
├── mobile/         # Flutter mobile application
└── server/         # Django REST Framework backend API
```

### Installation and Setup

Refer to the `client/web/README.md`, `client/mobile/README.md`, and `server/README.md` for detailed setup instructions for each component.
